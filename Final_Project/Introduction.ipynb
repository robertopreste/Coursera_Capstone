    "In a few months, I'm moving to Cambridge, UK to start a new job as a software developer. I'm currently looking for a flat, and I'll soon be looking for a bicycle to commute easily and keep healthy.  \n",
    "This brought me to a simple yet stimulating idea for this final project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we may want to open a new bicycle shop in Cambridge, UK. I've already lived there for some time, and from what I've seen, Cambridge is a very biker-friendly city, and it's got plenty of places where people can enjoy a ride on their two-wheeled companion and discover amazing views and fascinating landscapes. We, as brand new enterpreneurs in the bicycle business, we want to exploit the great opportunities that this city offers in order to open our profitable bicycle shop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we need to know whether any other bicycle shop already exists (spoiler alert - they do) and where they're located, so to avoid having to deal with a tight competition with other bicycle shop owners.  \n",
    "An important consideration we may want to take into account (and that I'll focus on in this project) is to decide where our shop will be located in relation with places where most people riding a bicycle might be found. Specifically, we will look for spots close to the riverside, or parks, or riding routes, or also gyms and sport venues, in order to maximise our profit: if someone (say, a tourist) walks along the river or across a park and sees all those people riding their bikes and having fun, probably he will think something like \"Oh man, I wish I had a bicycle too\".  \n",
    "And there we are, with our brand new shop full of shiny bicycles, that anyone can either buy or rent for a day!\n",
    "In the same way, it is more common to find someone whose bike needs a fix in these places, so we may also profit from bicycle repair and mainteinance. "
